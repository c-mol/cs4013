 *  An admin user can log in and can add a new employee to the system. 
 *  A human resources user can log in to implement the promotion functionality for full-time staff. 
 *  In such cases the staff member should be asked to confirm the promotional changes being applied. 
 *  A command line interface (CLI) should be included to facilitate this interaction between users and the application. 
 *  The CLI should be included with the expectation that a Graphical User Interface (GUI) may be required in the future. 
 *  In other words the separation between the text-based user interface should be well-defined to allow a graphical user interface to be substituted easily.
